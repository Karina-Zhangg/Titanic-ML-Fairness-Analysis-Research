TITANIC ML FAIRNESS ANALYISIS RESEARCH


This repository showcases my personal research project exploring survival prediction and fairness evaluation using the Titanic dataset. This project combines data science, machine learning, and fairness metrics to analyze survival factors and assess biases in predictive modeling. It demonstrates my ability to handle end-to-end data analysis while addressing critical ethical concerns in machine learning.

OBJECTIVE

The goal of this project is to:

-Build a predictive model using machine learning techniques (logistic regression) to analyze Titanic passenger survival.


-Evaluate the model’s performance through standard classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


-Assess the fairness of the model across sensitive features such as gender, socioeconomic class, and age, using fairness metrics like:


  Demographic Parity Difference


  Equal Opportunity Difference


  Equalized Odds Difference


  Skills Demonstrated


THIS PROJECT REFLECTS MY EXPERTISE IN:

-Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.


-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding dataset distributions, correlations, and feature engineering for better predictions.


-Machine Learning: Building and evaluating models with logistic regression while understanding their limitations.


-Fairness Analysis: Applying fairness metrics to identify potential biases in predictions and discussing their ethical implications.


-Communication: Presenting results through clear visualizations, reports, and fairness evaluations.



KEY FINDINGS:

Performance: The model achieved a high accuracy in predicting survival, supported by strong precision and recall scores.


Fairness Concerns: Fairness evaluations revealed disparities in true positive rates (TPR) and false positive rates (FPR) between groups based on gender, socioeconomic class, and age.


Opportunities for Improvement: I identified potential areas for enhancing fairness, including fairness-aware modeling and subgroup-specific rebalancing.



REPOSITORY CONTENT:

Titanic_Survival_Fairness_Analysis.ipynb: The full Jupyter Notebook containing the code, visualizations, and detailed analysis.


Data: The Titanic dataset was sourced from Kaggle, including cleaned and preprocessed versions for the analysis. The downloadable CSV file is also available in my repository named "Titanic.csv"



WHY THIS PROJECT MATTERS:

This project showcases my ability to:


-Address real-world problems with technical rigor and ethical responsibility.


-Balance performance optimization with fairness in machine learning models.


-Communicate insights clearly and effectively, making data-driven decisions accessible and actionable.



NEXT STEPS:


To improve upon this work:


-Incorporate advanced fairness-aware algorithms during training.


-Explore alternative machine learning models (e.g., Random Forests, Neural Networks) for comparison.


-Expand subgroup analysis to include intersectional fairness metrics.



ABOUT ME:
