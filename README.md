# Titanic-ML-Fairness-Analysis-Research
This repository showcases my personal research project exploring survival prediction and algorithmic fairness using the Titanic dataset. The project combines data science, machine learning, and fairness evaluation to investigate the factors influencing survival outcomes and evaluate the ethical implications of predictive modeling.
